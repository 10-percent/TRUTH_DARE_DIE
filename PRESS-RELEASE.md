There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Our product is a fun take on Truth or Dare where the player who fails to perform on a dare will get a death token and kicked out of the session which they were playing. If the user accrues three death tokens then their account and any video/picture attached to the user/room will be in public view on Twitter/Youtube.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  This product is for people looking to have some fun with friends, but with an interesting twist on it.


## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.\
  You’ve most likely played truth or dare once before in your life, so imagine a version where you could play with your friends from anywhere, but with an interesting twist on it. Upon the failure to perform a dare, subject to your peers, you will get a death token which will kick you out of your current session. The dares can vary from a simple text admission and can ramp all the way up to posting a video in the playroom showing you performing the dare. If the room leader decides to make the room public, any videos of you performing a dare will be uploaded to the Graveyard Youtube account and made public upon the given death token accumulation. In the chance of a tiebreaker when deciding if someone performed a dare or not then that person will be subject to a double dare, if the double dare is completed then they will be granted a save token which is good to get rid of one death token. Save tokens will carry over separate sessions.
  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  This solves the ever ongoing entertainment problem.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  This product gives the user a fun and interactive way to play with their friends either locally or remotely.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  To get started make an account by signing up through Google or Twitter and then make a room and give your friends the unique room session id.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  “Wow it was really fun to watch my friends do really stupid things or get kicked out, it’s really truth or dare from anywhere”


## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  After learning about all this how could you resist the urge to get some friends, sign up, and have some wacky fun in this rendition of truth or dare.
